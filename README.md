BusWear (:bus::watch:) is a simple library for EventBus to support Android Wear devices. Just adding one line of code lets you get synchronized event buses on Wear and mobile platform.

###What is EventBus?

A great multi-purpose tool for Android apps, great way of triggering some events in separate Activity, Fragment, Service etc.

[EventBus, origin of that project](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) or [Otto](https://github.com/square/otto).

###How to start?

To start with BusWear all you need is to add a dependency. That is it!

###Add BusWear to your project

BusWear is available on Maven Central.

Gradle:
```
    compile 'pl.tajchert:buswear:0.9.2'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:+'
```

Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>pl.tajchert</groupId>
    <artifactId>buswear</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```

###How to use?

You can post to remote branch as long as it `implements Parcelable`, other "non-Parcelable" object you still can post but only locally.


`post(parcelableObject, context);` sends your parcelable object both to local bus and to remote one as well.

`postLocal(object)` works as old `post()` of EventBus, it sends event only locally.

`postRemote(parcelableObject, context)` sends your parcelable object to remote bus only.

The same goes for Sticky events - so you get `postSticky()`, `postStickyLocal()`, `postStickyRemote()`. However not all "sticky" functionality is supported yet - ex. `removeStickyEvent()` is not implemented (TODO), and works only locally.


###Questions?

**Why does it uses whole code of EventBus instead of "extends EventBus"?**

_As it overrides some private methods to get for example subscribed method classes of parameters for unparcelling objects after receiving them in Parcel. If that problem will be resolved I will be glad to use EventBus as dependency._

**What are some drawbacks?**

_Probably quite big one is that all your objects to be posted needs to implement `Parcelable`. I recommend using for that purpose some library such as Parceler, Hrisey or Auto-Parcel for this._

###Thanks

Goes to [Polidea](https://www.polidea.com/) for putting me on a project that encouraged me to work on that library, Maciej GÃ³rski for Manifest merger, and Dariusz Seweryn for idea with Class name in path String.
